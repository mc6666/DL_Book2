# Diffusion 101

This package is the starting point for understanding diffusion models. We implement a simple version of the DDPM model on a toy 2D dataset. For all of the explanation, theory, and math behind diffusion, please read through the tutorial.md notes. We cover some of the physics behind these models, give an interpretation of these models as learning path integrals, and also explain 3 fundamental papers in the area: the 2015 jascha et. al. Deep Unsupervised paper, the 2020 DDPM paper, and the 2020 Song SDE paper.
